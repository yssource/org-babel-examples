  Org removes some of the intermediate files if the variable =org-latex-remove-logfiles=
  is set to true. So, for debugging, it makes sense to set it to nil.

** Equations

 - Nice link for mathematical symbols [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols_by_subject][on wikipedia]]:
  
 This is an example for an equation

 $$
   cores_{extrapol} = cores_{intern2013} \cdot offl\% \cdot \frac{gf \cdot (volume_{user} + volume_{intern})}{volume_{intern}}
 $$

 #+LATEX: \vspace{0.1\textheight}

 This is an example for an equation embedded in the text 
 $cores_{extrapol} = cores_{intern2013} \cdot offl\% \cdot \frac{gf \cdot (volume_{user} + volume_{intern})}{volume_{intern}}$
 The text continues after the formula.

 #+LATEX: \vspace{0.1\textheight}

 Here follows a numbered equation that also can be referenced like in
 the following parentheses (eq \ref{eq_1}). Note that we have to rely
 here on standard latex syntax, since org mode does not offer equations
 as a native element that we can mark up with #+NAME tags, etc.
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq_1}
   cores_{extrapol} = cores_{intern2013} \cdot offl\% \cdot \frac{gf \cdot (volume_{user} + volume_{intern})}{volume_{intern}}
 \end{equation}

 # Units should be typeset differently from math symbols. This can be done using
 # the =units.sty= package that can be loaded in a =#+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA: \usepackage{units}=
 # definition.

 # $$
 # \unit[20]{s}imap://psich%5Cfeichtinger@mail.ethz.ch:993/fetch%3EUID%3E/INBOX%3E488946 \cdot \unit[9.81]{m/s^2} = \unit[196.2]{m/s} 
 # $$

 from an [[http://stefaanlippens.net/textnormal][article by Stefaan Lippens]] on on using /textnormal/ for including
 normal text correctly in a math environment.

 \begin{eqnarray*}
  \int_1^9 x dx & & \textrm{this is textrm}\\
  \sum_1^9 y    & & \textsf{this is textsf}\\
  \prod_1^9 z   & & \textnormal{this is textnormal}
 \end{eqnarray*}

 Only textnormal will guarantee that the text appears in the default font of
 the document.

 #+LaTeX: \pagebreak

** Figures

   I can reference the figure like this: Fig. [[fig_simplegraph1]].

   Note
   - there must be no empty line between the picture's link and the meta
     definitions for name, caption, etc.
   - The figure must have a caption.
   - The OPTION =tex:t= must be set for references to work.

   | Specifier | Permission                                                                      |
   |-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | h         | Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the    |
   |           | source text (however, not exactly at the spot)                                  |
   | t         | Position at the top of the page.                                                |
   | b         | Position at the bottom of the page.                                             |
   | p         | Put on a special page for floats only.                                          |
   | \!        | Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions. |
   | H         | Places the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. Requires the      |
   |           | float package, e.g., \textbackslash{}usepackage{float}. This is somewhat equivalent to h!. |

   #+NAME: fig_simplegraph1
   #+CAPTION: A simple graph
   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.8\textwidth :float t :placement [H]
   [[file:../beamer/fig/simplegraph1.png]]

   #+NAME: fig_simplegraph1b
   #+CAPTION: A simple graph at half the width
   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.4\textwidth :float t :placement [H]

   #+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.8\textwidth :float t :placement [H] :options angle=270
   [[file:../beamer/fig/simplegraph1.png]]
  
   A pdf can be included the same way, e.g. by specifying
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options page=10 :width 10cm
   [[file:myfig.pdf]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Tables

   - Documentation
     - Very nice overview: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables

*** nicer table formatting using booktab style

    Some [[http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf][interesting tips]] for \myindex{booktab style tables} by M. PÃ¼schel.
  
    Booktabs can be turned on by default for all tables by
    setting this variable for the document or globally:
    : org-latex-tables-booktabs: t

    Whether table captions appear above or below the table can be configured using this
    variable setting:
    : org-latex-table-caption-above: nil

    #+NAME: tblDefault
    #+CAPTION: default table
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
    | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
    |----------+----------+----------+----------|
    |        1 |       10 |      100 |     1000 |
    |        2 |       11 |      101 |     1001 |
    |        3 |       12 |      102 |     1002 |
    |        4 |       13 |      103 |     1003 |
    |        5 |       14 |      104 |     1004 |
    |----------+----------+----------+----------|
    |       15 |       60 |      510 |     5010 |
    #+TBLFM: @>$1..@$4=vsum(@I..II)

    #+NAME: tblBooktabs
    #+CAPTION: table using booktabs style
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :booktabs t
    | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
    |----------+----------+----------+----------|
    |        1 |       10 |      100 |     1000 |
    |        2 |       11 |      101 |     1001 |
    |        3 |       12 |      102 |     1002 |
    |        4 |       13 |      103 |     1003 |
    |        5 |       14 |      104 |     1004 |
    |----------+----------+----------+----------|
    |       15 |       60 |      510 |     5010 |
    #+TBLFM: @>$1..@$4=vsum(@I..II)

  
*** Math in tables

    Use /math/ or /inline math/ together with /array/ environment.

    Here we use the simple math mode
    #+ATTR_LaTeX: :mode math :environment array
    | Column 1 | Column 2 |
    |----------+----------|
    | \sin(x)  | \tan(x)  |

    This uses the =inline-math= mode
    #+ATTR_LaTeX: :mode inline-math :environment array
    | Column 1 | Column 2 |
    |----------+----------|
    | \sin(x)  | \tan(x)  |


*** Table font size

    The font size is determined by the =:font= switch in the =#+ATTR_LATEX= line.
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
    | Column 1  | Column 2        |
    |-----------+-----------------|
    | Some text | Some other text |
    | 10        | 20              |

    Sidenote:
    - When a caption is used, the latex export uses a =table=
      environment.
    - The previous captionless table generates a =tabular=
      environment.

    #+CAPTION: Table small size
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :font \small
    | Column 1  | Column 2        |
    |-----------+-----------------|
    | Some text | Some other text |
    | 10        | 20              |

    #+CAPTION: Table footnotesize
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :font \footnotesize
    | Column 1  | Column 2        |
    |-----------+-----------------|
    | Some text | Some other text |
    | 10        | 20              |

    #+CAPTION: Table scriptsize
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :font \scriptsize
    | Column 1  | Column 2        |
    |-----------+-----------------|
    | Some text | Some other text |
    | 10        | 20              |

    #+CAPTION: Table tiny size
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H] :font \tiny
    | Column 1  | Column 2        |
    |-----------+-----------------|
    | Some text | Some other text |
    | 10        | 20              |


*** Sidewaystable

    Using the sidewaystable together with a =:placement [H]= specifier
    requires that one uses the =rotfloat= environment.

    #+NAME: tblSideways
    #+CAPTION: A sidewaystable
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :font \footnotesize :float sidewaystable :placement [H]
    | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 |
    |----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
    |        1 |       10 |      100 |     1000 | example  | result   |
    |        2 |       11 |      101 |     1001 | example  | result   |
    |        3 |       12 |      102 |     1002 | example  | result   |
    |        4 |       13 |      103 |     1003 | example  | result   |
    |        5 |       14 |      104 |     1004 | example  | result   |
    |        6 |       15 |      105 |     1005 | example  | result   |
    |        7 |       16 |      106 |     1006 | example  | result   |

    This text comes after the sidewaystable (we want to check whether the
    placement modifier was observed).

    Even though in the [[info:org#LaTeX%20specific%20attributes][info documentation it reads]]: "Note: :placement
    is ignored for :float sideways tables.", the modifier =[H]= is
    observed, as can be confirmed in the resulting PDF.

*** Table over multiple pages with long text wrapped to cell width
    Use the \myindex{longtabu} environment. This requires that you
    have loaded the \myindex{tabu} and \myindex{longtable} packages.


    # In order to get homogeneous line spacings, I need to set the following
    # parameter (q.v. https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/21570/strange-line-spacing-effects-in-longtabu)

*** COMMENT DOES NOT WORK: Radio tables and skipping columns and rows

    The reason why it does not work is that the feature is only
    implemented for some modes. Org is not among them.
    See Org info chapter: /A.6.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables/.
   
    The =:splice t= setting in the following ORGTBL definition
    will result in only the table's body lines to be returned,
    and not to wrap them into a tabular environment.

    # NOTE: This example only works if the comment environment has been
    # included.

 # END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures

** Source code

   In order to get nice source code formatting and markup, one needs to add the *minted* package. I add here
   the relevant excerpt from my emacs initialization file (listing [[listing-minted-config]]), which also serves as a first lisp code example

   #+NAME: listing-minted-config
   #+CAPTION: emacs init.el snippet for including code markup by minted
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code
     (eval-after-load "ox-latex"
       '(progn 
          ;; we want source code blocks to be syntax colored when exporting
          ;; via latex.  We configure latex minted which uses python
          ;; pygments
          (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "minted"))
          (setq org-latex-listings 'minted)
          ;; define mappings of src-code-language to lexer that minted shall use
          ;;(add-to-list 'org-latex-listings-langs '(ipython "Python"))
          (add-to-list 'org-latex-minted-langs '(ipython "python"))))
   #+END_SRC

   
   I also add listing [[listing-example-c]] as an example for C code markup:

   #+NAME: listing-example-c
   #+CAPTION: C code markup example 
   #+BEGIN_SRC C :exports code
     #include "stdlib.h"
     int main(int argc,char **argv) {
       printf("Hello World");
       exit(0);
     }
   #+END_SRC

** Footnotes and margin notes

   Examples for \myindex{footnotes}: This is a text with a
   \myindex{footnote} [fn:1]. The footnote will be displayed on the
   bottom of the current page. One can also place all footnotes in a
   separate chapter called /footnotes/ at the end of the org
   file[fn:2].

   Footnotes definitions can be placed within an org section using the
   =[fn:1]= syntax and observing that no leading indentation is
   allowed on such a line. Alternatively the footnotes can be
   collected in a special section called "Footnotes". I recommend
   reading the respective INFO entry (e.g. there is also the
   possibility to define footnotes inline). When using =C-c C-x f= to
   insert footnotes a lot of the work is taken over by org itself
   (also allows footnote renumbering, etc.). One can jump between the
   footnote reference and its definition by the usual =C-c C-o=
   combination.


    
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT LaTeX
      \newcommand{\mymarginpar}[1]{%
	\marginpar[\raggedleft#1]{\raggedright#1}}   
    #+END_EXPORT
    \myindex{Margin notes} can be inserted by directly inlining the LaTeX command
    #+LATEX:\marginpar{\textit{a default margin note}}
    as demonstrated in the source code for this section. By default
    the margin notes are justified. This often looks awkward. Using
    this [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/32173/raggedouter-to-typeset-marginal-text-in-twoside-book][stackexchange answer]], I define a macro which yields:

    I like the margin notes to be left aligned instead of being justified.
    #+LATEX:\mymarginpar{\textit{a left aligned margin note that looks nicer}}

** References to sections, figures, tables, equations

   Here, we show the usage of links to the text sections:
   Examples for References to figures are also found in chapter
   [[Figures]], to tables in chapter [[Tables]], and to equations in chapter
   [[Equations]].

   Other references
   - Figures can be referenced like this: Fig. [[fig_simplegraph1]].
   - These are references to table [[tblDefault]] and table [[tblBooktabs]].
   - And an example of an equation reference: eq \ref{eq_1}. This reference
     requires latex syntax and a latex label as target. All the other
     links work based on org link syntax can use the name given to
     the elements via a leading =#+NAME:= line.
   


* some interesting links
   - Org LaTeX exports
     - Subfigures in an org document for exporting to LaTeX: [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/92821][gmane.emacs.orgmode/92821]]
   - Hyperlink formatting
     - described in the LaTeX [[http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/doc/manual.pdf][hyperref]] manual.
     - This is an example of how to get links that are not framed by red
       rectangles, but just have a blue font color

* Index creation

  Must be solved by including LaTeX source commands:
  - Requires in the preamble
    - =\usepackage{makeidx}=
    - =\makeindex=
  - Mark up words by =\index{word}=
  - At the location where the index should apear, use =\printindex=
  - to render the document, a call to the =makeindex= binary needs to
    be added in the build command. I use the following definition in
    my =init.el=.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code
      (setq org-latex-pdf-process
            (let
                ((cmd (concat "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode"
                              " -output-directory %o %f")))
              (list cmd
                    "cd %o; if test -r %b.idx; then makeindex %b.idx; fi"
                    cmd
                    cmd)))
    #+END_SRC

* References

  Some important org references that also display that citations directly following each
  other will be combined cite:schulte2012multi cite:dominik2010org.
  And another single reference cite:feichtinger1997direct.

  The =#+BIBLIOGRAPHY:= command inserts the reference list at the
  location where it is placed. It requires the name of the bib-file
  (without .bib extension) and the name of a style (e.g. plain).
  
  For HTML exports one can also pass options to the =bibtex2html=
  binary (look at the comments section of =ox-bibtex.el= and also the
  bibtex2html man page).

  #+CAPTION: bibtex2html options
  | option | functionality                                |
  |--------+----------------------------------------------|
  | -d     | sort by date                                 |
  | -a     | sort as BibTeX (usually by author) *default* |
  | -u     | unsorted i.e. same order as in .bib file     |
  | -r     | reverse the sort                             |
  | -t     | limit to entries cited in document           |

 Multiple options can be combined as follows:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  option:-d option:-r 
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To get the citations correctly processed rendered, one needs to add
  a bibtex invocation to the LaTeX command chain:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports code
    (setq org-latex-pdf-process
          (let
              ((cmd (concat "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode"
                            " --synctex=1"
                            " -output-directory %o %f")))
            (list cmd
                  "cd %o; if test -r %b.idx; then makeindex %b.idx; fi"
                  "cd %o; bibtex %b"
                  cmd
                  cmd)))
  #+END_SRC


  To just produce a bibliography of all items in the bib file, one can
  use the following LaTeX snippet. The =\nocite{*}= command includes
  an item that has not been cited in the document; a star matches all
  documents, so all get included (q.v. [[http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/bibliographies0.html][this link]]).
  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ,#+BEGIN_LATEX
      \documentstyle{amsart}
      \begin{document}
      \nocite{*}
      \bibliographystyle{amsplain}
      \bibliography{bib-filename}
      \end{document}
